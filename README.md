# 🦠 Malaria Diagnosis Using Deep Learning

This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for automatic malaria diagnosis using microscopic blood cell images. Leveraging the TensorFlow Malaria Dataset, it trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as Parasitized or Uninfected. Automated detection of malaria-infected blood cells using TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


**The system uses:**

    TensorFlow for model development
    
    NumPy for preprocessing and numerical operations
    
    Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization and performance analysis
    
    This project demonstrates how AI can support disease diagnosis by providing fast, reliable, and scalable image-based screening.
